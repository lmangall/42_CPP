Dependency Flags
DEPFLAGS = -MMD -MP
-MMD: Generates dependency files during compilation, excluding system headers. This helps in tracking dependencies for each source file to ensure that changes trigger recompilation of affected files only.
-MP: Adds a phony target for each dependency, mitigating errors when a dependency file is removed. It ensures the build process continues smoothly even if a non-critical header file is missing.




______________________


Default Constructor
- Initializes a new instance of a class.
- Called when an object is created without providing explicit arguments.

Copy Constructor
- Initializes a new instance of a class by making a copy of an existing object.
- Called when an object is initialized from another object, passed as a copy to a function, or returned from a function by value.

Copy Assignment Operator
- Assigns the values from one instance of a class to another existing instance.
- Called when an object is assigned the value of another object of the same class.

Destructor
- Cleans up an instance of a class when it is no longer needed.
- Called automatically when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

These components are crucial for managing resources efficiently, preventing memory leaks, and ensuring deep copies of objects when needed, adhering to the principles of OCF in C++ class design.


```c++
class MyClass {
public:
    // Default constructor
    MyClass() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    // Copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        // Code to copy the object from 'other' to this instance
    }

    // Copy assignment operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment
            // Code to copy the object from 'other' to this instance
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        // Cleanup code here
    }
};
